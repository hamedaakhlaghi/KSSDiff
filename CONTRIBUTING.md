# Contributing to KSSDiff

If you are going to contribute to this project, please make yourself familiar with our standards and
procedures:

* [Git Procedures](https://www.kss.cc/standards-git.html)
* [Swift Coding Standards](https://www.kss.cc/standards-swift.html)

_However_, since this code is largely a port of Python3 code, the syntax does not entirely match our
normal coding standards. Specifically naming conventions, and even a couple of operators, are following
that of the original python3 code. But any new additions made should follow the proper Swift standards.

_Note_ that the iOS version is not currently included in the CI. That may change as we work on
more iOS projects, but for now the iOS version of the tests must be run manually within Xcode.
